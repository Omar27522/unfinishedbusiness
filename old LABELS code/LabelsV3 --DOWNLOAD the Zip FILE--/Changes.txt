Label Maker


* The naming logic should be improved.

* While manually creating a label, the text field should have a character limit, like the int limit for the UPC
    - Maybe shift automatically to the second line, when The user pastes the name into the product name field.

* I was thinking of hosting the CSV file somewhere. And releasing new updates on a regular basis.
        as more more items are added. I would need to think hard about this.
