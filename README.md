<h2>Inventory Management</h2>

<h2>MySite</h2>
<p>
There are several iterations of this project.<br/ >
Basically the page asks for a name. The user is not required to supply a name.<br>
Then the user has to pick many or one picture with checkboxes.<br />
At the end of this, the program tells the user their name and the selected images<br />
my problem is that if no name is supplied the program asks for a name on the pick a picture page as well
but I cannot code the erros.
